        <p>I came to this world as the child of a dream giver.Trying to work it all out on my way to the moon.When time runs me around, give my word to the grave diggers.I’m just passing through Sometimes.. I wish that lived in the middle of nowhere. With a couple of dogs and a ranch on a farm. I don’t even like farming or early mornings
        It just sounds calm  </p>
